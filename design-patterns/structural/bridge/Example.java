/**
 * Purpose: Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that each may vary independently
 *          The Bridge is the communication layer between your code and the other system.
 *
 *          (e.g. JDBC Driver bridge <- inject a driver depends on DB system.)
 *
 *
 * Control can be designed and plugged into a Vehicle without affecting other systems
 * Engine can be designed and plugged into a Control without affecting other systems
 *
 * Vehicle has Control interface
 * Control has Engine interface
 *
 * Actual objects for Control and Engine can be swapped by Dependency Injection
 *
 *
 * Bridge pattern use Dependency Injection. Dependency Injection is not a pattern, Design guideline.
