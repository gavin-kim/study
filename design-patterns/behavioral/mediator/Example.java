/**
 * Purpose: Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
 *          Mediator promotes loose coupling and lets you vary their interaction independently
 *
 *          Mediator knows about the role of each component and takes
 *          responsibility for managing their interaction
 *
 *          mediator <---> Ignition
 *                   <---> Gearbox
 *                   <---> Accelerator
 *                   <---> Brake
 *
 *          Mediator has Component's reference.
 *          Component also has Mediator's reference.
 *
 *          User      -> invokes a method in Mediator
 *          Mediator  -> handles components (Ignition, Gearbox, Accelerator, Brake)
 *          Component -> return something to Mediator
 *          Mediator  -> show the value from components graphically
