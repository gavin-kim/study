# Algorithm
Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat <italic>n * log(n)</italic> (worst-case) running time, since <italic>n * log(n)</italic> represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element
