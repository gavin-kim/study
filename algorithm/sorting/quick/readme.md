# QuickSort

A constant factor of 1.39N lg N whenever it is used to sort N items. The same is true of mergesort,<br>
but quicksort is typically faster because (even though it does 39 percent more compares)
<hr>
Insertion Sort and the simple version of Quicksort were stable, <br> 
but the faster **in-place** version of Quicksort was not (since it scrambled around elements while sorting).

<h3>To improve the performance</h3>

<h4>Cut off to insertion sort:</h4> 
`if (hi <= lo) return;` ==> `if (hi <= lo + M) { Insertion.sort(a, lo, hi); return; }` <br>
The optimum value of the cutoff M is system-dependent, but any value between 5 and 15 is likely to work well in most situations

<h4>Median-of-three partitioning:</h4>

<h4>Entropy-optimal sorting:</h4> 
Quicksort with 3-way partitioning is entropy-optimal. 

Arrays with large numbers of dubplicated keys. For example, a subarray that consists solely of items that are equal does not
need to be processed further, but general quicksort keeps partitioning down to small subarrays.
