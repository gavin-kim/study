# QuickSort

A constant factor of 1.39N lg N whenever it is used to sort N items. The same is true
of mergesort, but quicksort is typically faster because (even though it does 39 percent
more compares) it does much less data movement. This mathematical assurance is
probabilistic, but you can certainly rely upon it.
<hr>
Insertion Sort and the simple version of Quicksort were stable, <br> 
but the faster in-place version of Quicksort was not (since it scrambled around elements while sorting).
